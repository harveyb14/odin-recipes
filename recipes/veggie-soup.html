    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Chop all vegetables that are being baked (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, zucchini, etc.) and place them on a baking tray. Lather them in any oil of choosing. I like to use Avocado Oil or Olive Oil! Then put in oven until browned! (about 15 minutes)</li>
        <li>Chop the vegetables that will be sautéed. (Onion, bell pepper, celery)</li>
        <li>In a large pot, sauté onion with olive oil. Then add bell pepper and celery. Sauté for 5-7 minutes or until softened/onions are clear. Add garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in all baked vegetables and cook for 3 more minutes, mixing constantly.</li>
        <li>Add in chicken broth and vegetable broth until vegetables are covered and float off the bottom just a little bit! (I use one full container of chicken broth and 1 cup of vegetable broth) 1. Add in 4 chicken bouillon cubes, 1/2-1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of cheese (any of your choosing), and about 5 tablespoons of butter.</li>
        <li>(Optional) take immersion blender and start to purée the vegetables, go until 95% of the vegetables are puréed. 1. Add in salt, pepper, cumin, thyme, basil, oregano, onion powder, parsley, and rosemary. 2. Boil for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Voila! All done!</li>
    </ol>
