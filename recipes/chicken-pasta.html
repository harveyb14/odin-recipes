    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>**Season the Chicken:** In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with Cajun seasoning until they are well coated.</li>
        <li>**Cook the Chicken:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>**Sauté Vegetables:** In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed. Sauté the red bell pepper, onion, and garlic until they are soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>**Cook the Pasta:** While the vegetables are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the penne pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>**Create the Sauce:** Add the chicken broth to the skillet with the vegetables, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>**Combine:** Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Let it simmer for a few minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>**Mix with Pasta:** Add the cooked penne pasta to the skillet and toss everything together until the pasta is well coated with the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>**Serve:** Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
